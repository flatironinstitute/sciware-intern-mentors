# Jupyter Notebooks

outline:
- notebooks useful for mixing plots, text, and code
- jupyter notebooks not good with git (from [here](https://www.reviewnb.com/git-jupyter-notebook-ultimate-guide)):
    - Notebook Git diffs are hard to review 
    - Resolving notebook merge conflict is painful
    - Large notebooks fail to render on GitHub 
    - Notebook code reviews & collaboration is tough
- in general, move towards using scripts / write modular code
