# Jupyter Notebooks

## Overview
Jupyter notebooks are powerful tools for scientific computing that allow you to mix code, explanatory text, and visualizations in a single document. They're particularly useful for:
- Interactive data analysis and exploration
- Creating reproducible research documents
- Teaching and documentation
- Prototyping and experimentation

## Git Integration Challenges
While notebooks are great for development, they present some challenges when used with version control systems like Git:
- Notebook Git diffs are hard to review 
- Resolving notebook merge conflicts is painful
- Large notebooks fail to render on GitHub 
- Notebook code reviews & collaboration is tough

## Best Practices
To overcome these challenges, consider these approaches:

1. **Use Text-Based Notebooks**
   - Convert notebooks to text-based formats using [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
   - Save notebooks as `.md` or `.py` files
   - Interact with these files through Jupyter Lab as if they were regular `.ipynb` files
   - Outputs are not saved to disk by default, making diffs cleaner

2. **Modular Code Development**
   - Move complex logic into separate Python modules
   - Use notebooks primarily for visualization and documentation
   - Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks or analyses

3. **Version Control Tips**
   - Use [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for better notebook diffs
   - Consider using [reviewnb](https://www.reviewnb.com/) for notebook code reviews
   - Keep notebooks small and focused
