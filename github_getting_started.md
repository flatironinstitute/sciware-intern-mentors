# Getting a student started with GitHub

In addition to the student needing their own GitHub account, every laptop needs a little configuration in order to play nice. 
In particular, the student's username and email address needs to be set. Also, students should setup SSH keys in order to authenticate.
These steps are all described in the GitHub documentation: [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git).

- [Setting your username in git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/setting-your-username-in-git)
  - The name can be however the student wants to be identified in the commit history. It does not need to be their real name nor their GitHub username.
- [Setting your commit email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-GitHub/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address)
  - This should be the email address associated with the student's GitHub account.
- [Setup SSH keys with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
  - These keys are hardware specific and need to be setup on every machine the student may use.
