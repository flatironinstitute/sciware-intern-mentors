# Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly.

Flatiron does not currently provide GitHub Copilot through our educational institutional organization. As a Flatiron researcher, students are eligible for [GitHub education benefits](https://education.github.com/teachers) which include access to Copilot. Students can request these benefits with either their FI affiliation or via their student status at their home institution.
