# Github Projects

A possible tool for managing projects in a centralized location is [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects)

## Creating a project

- [Creating a user project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#creating-a-user-project)
  - blank project / recommended templates?
  - [setting up the project description and readme](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project#updating-your-project-description-and-readme)
- [Project access - inviting collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects#managing-access-for-user-level-projects)

## Adding content

You can start tracking progress by adding items to the project.
These are linked to github issues or PRs that are associated to specific repositories that contain the data for the student's project.
To add them to the project, you can either:
- link existing issues or PRs
- create new ones directly in the project view

You can attach additional information to these items.
By default, some information will already be filled in, such as the repository, the labels, ...
You can also add additional custom fields to attach arbitrary data to the items.
These fields can then be used to lay out the data in a comprehensible way.

## Visualization

There are three main layouts to visualize the data.
These can each serve different purposes, and you can have multiple views for a single project.

- [table layout](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-table-layout)
- [board layout](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-board-layout)
- [roadmap layout](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-roadmap-layout)

## Status updates

Finally, you could also use the project to keep track of [status updates](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/sharing-project-updates)
.
These are markdown formatted messages that will remain visible and can be referred back to.
